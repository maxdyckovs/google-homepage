This is my first 'actual' project. I'll be making the Google homepage... hopefully somewhat accurate to the real one. To do so, I have been asked to demonstrate some certain skills:
1. Two ways to move a div around on the page.
  This would be the `position` and `float` elements. And the values "left" or "right".
2. Stick a div onto the bottom or top of the page.
  This would be done using `position` "top" or "bottom".
3. Identify the background color of an existing webpage.
  Can use devtools, or "inspect element" and find the element in css `background-color`.
4. Grab the URL for an image from an existing webpage.
  Use "inspect element" on image and search for <link> element.
  "Copy link address" from right click.
  Seperate image into page by itself.
5. Center an element horizontally. `margin: auto;`
6. Identify three ways you can include your CSS styles in a page.
7. Understand how to use classes and ids to target CSS at specific elements on the page.
8. Build a very basic form (even if it doesn't "go" anywhere).
